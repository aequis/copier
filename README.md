Basic Python-based wrapper for rsync

This probably isn't useful for anybody. I only wanted this as a more convenient interface to copy a particular set of files to a destination (as opposed to an entire source folder).

The initial commit was entirely written in Google AI Studio with Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental, which is why there's no commit history before then.

The rest came about when I realized this would be an interesting case study (for myself) in how to use AI to write and iterate upon a GUI-based Python project. 99.9999% of the code is AI-written using VS Code Insiders, Roo Code and the Gemini API with Gemini 2.5 Pro preview.

As of the current commit, I'd estimate the costs so far to be around $25, including something like $5 wasted trying to get the AI to implement and run proper tests.
